    p As a User Experience Designer, I aim to create simple and enjoyable online experiences. Connecting user research, client needs, and design in a meaningful way is something that I am passionate about.
    p After graduating with a BFA in Fine Arts, I began to explore the possibility of applying my visual design background to the field of computer science. However, I wanted to be able to create experiences that were both visually compelling and user centric.
    p I enrolled in General Assembly's User Experience Design Immersive and spent 8 weeks learning and developing my new UX skills.  During the course, I had the opportunity to learn a variety of user research methods, design processes, and prototyping programs.
